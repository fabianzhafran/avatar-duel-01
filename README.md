# IF2210 Project Template

Here is an example of project using gradle as the build tools.
Try running these commands:

`./gradlew run`

You will notice that it will open a window that display 'Avatar Duel'.
In the command line you can see the data that is being read by `CSVReader.java`

What happen is when you use `./gradlew run`, it will start the main function in your app.
For this app, the main function lives in `AvatarDuel.java`.
